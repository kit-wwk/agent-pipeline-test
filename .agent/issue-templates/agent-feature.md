AGENT PIPELINE INSTRUCTIONS
==========================
When you add the `agent` label to this issue, the Agent pipeline will:

1. **Planning Phase**: Create a spec.md and plan.md with implementation approach
2. **Review**: You'll be asked to approve the plan with a 👍 reaction
3. **Task Generation**: Break down the plan into executable tasks
4. **Implementation**: Execute tasks one by one with commits
5. **QA Phase**: Validate the implementation against acceptance criteria
6. **PR Creation**: Create a pull request for review

You can interact with the agent by:
- Reacting with 👍 to approve and proceed
- Reacting with 👎 to request changes
- Commenting with specific feedback or clarifications

Labels track the current state (e.g., agent:planning, agent:implementing, agent:qa-passed)
